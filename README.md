Practice ruby program with sql/postgres, organizes expenses with categories. Users can add expenses, add categories to expenses, view all expenses, search for expenses, limit search to certain categories, limit searches to certain values, and calculate how much they are spending per category. Each expense can belong to many categories, and each category can have many expenses.  

Certain terms are left more wordy than necessary (ie, expense_name as opposed to name within the Expenses class) for clarity purposes when viewing how the many to many relationship here works in the future. Similarly, comments remain for future illustrative purposes.
